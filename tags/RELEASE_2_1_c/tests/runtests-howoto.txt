HOWTO: runs tests for the Generic Resource Adapter for JMS with Sun Java System Application Server 8.1 UR1 and above.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial Setup
--------------

1. Install application server

Download and install the version of Glassfish/Sun Java System Application Server that you wish to test with

These tests have been run with Glassfish 2.1.1, Glassfish 3.0.1, Glassfish 3.1

2. Install Ant

Download and install Ant (I used 1.7.1), and add its bin directory to your path 

Download ant-contrib from http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/ to your machine
and copy the jar (I used ant-contrib-1.0b3.jar) to the lib directory of your ant installation

3. Set Environment variables

Set RA_HOME to the directory where the genericjmsra workspace is checked out
Set S1AS_HOME to your application server installation directory
Add S1AS_HOME/bin to your PATH.
Add <Ant Home>/bin to your PATH (as mentioned above)

4. Review config files

Review $RA_HOME/config/config.properties to see if any adjustments are needed (server ports etc)

Setup for running tests in Glassfish MQ
----------------------------------------------------------

Glassfish 2.x: nothing to do

Glassfish 3.x: Copy imq.jar, imqutil.jar, imqjmx.jar, and imqbroker.jar from glassfish/mq/lib to glassfish/lib


To run all tests
----------------

1. Perform the steps outlined in the "Initial Setup" section above.

2. Start the application server

3. cd $RA_HOME/tests and type in 
	  ant all
   The "all" target deploys and configures the resource adapter, runs all the tests, 
   and undeploys the resource adapter.

4. The test run results are also placed at $RA_HOME/tests/genericratests.output.

To run an individual test
------------------------

1. Perform the steps outlined in the "Initial Setup" section above.

2. Start the application server

3. cd $RA_HOME/tests and type in 
	 ant gmq async xa setup 
	 (to deploy the GenericJMSRA RA in Glassfish to use Glassfish MQ with DeliveryType=Asynchronous) 
	 or
	 ant wljms sync noxa setup (to deploy the GenericJMSRA RA in Glassfish to use WebLogic JMS with DeliveryType=Synchronous) 
	 
	
4  cd $RA_HOME/tests/<the-test-you-want-to-run> and type in 
      ant gmq async all 
      
   if you prefer you can run each stage of the test separately: the tasks are
      ant gmq build
      ant gmq xa setup
      ant deploy
      ant run
      ant undeploy
      ant unsetup
      
5. After you have run the tests you want to run, cd $RA_HOME/tests and type in 
	 ant unsetup
