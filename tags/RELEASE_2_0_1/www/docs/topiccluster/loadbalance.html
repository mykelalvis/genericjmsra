<big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single instances of applications often cannot
cater
to the ever increasing demands created by new business requirements
that mushroom everyday. So, the need of the hour would be to leverage
the enterprise features of an application server (like glassfish or
SJSAS 8.2) and create a server cluster. Any application that is
deployed on the cluster would be be deployed (and is accessible) from
all the individual instances in that cluster. The application server
provides a homogeneous view of the applications deployed in a cluster
and abstracts the user from the underlying complexities and also
enterprise class scalability, reliability, availability and load
balancing. Load Balancing for applications (EJB/Servlets that are
typically HTTP requests ) is managed by the transparantely by the
application server. But for message driven beans , which more often
than not, receive messages from JMS destinations, the onus of load
balancing ( or guaranteeing mutual exclusion) lies with either the
application or the resource adapter. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MDB in every instance of the cluster has to be
aware ( or be made aware) of what messages it needs to process and what
it needs to reject. Today, the logic of selecting messages has to be
present inside an MDB, and reasonable amount of intelligence has to be
programmed into it so that the same JMS message is not processed ( or
even received) by other instances in the cluster. The problem is pretty
straightforward if mdbs are consuming messages from Queue destinations.
One can&nbsp; be sure that only one instance of the mdb is going to
receive the message. The same issue becomes quite ominous if Topics are
used. Because all instances of the MDB ( are subscribers) would
receive&nbsp; the message, and unless there is a unique selector (or
conditions) that is configured into each one of them, the same message
would end up getting processed by all the instances. The following
article discusses&nbsp; how the above problem can be solved using the
generic jms ra, with minimal configuration and absolutely no code
change to the application (MDB).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem description can be depicted using the
Figure 1 below.&nbsp; The Foo jms resource adapter here is not capable
of selecting messages that have to be delivered to the unique
instances. Instead it just follows the JMS topic subscription model,
and delivers the message to all instances. So all the messages
1,2,.....N are processed by all instances, and the result being all the
messages end up getting processed 3 (N) times. Well, though this is not
a defect in the RA or the MDB design, it is undesirable in a reliable
and highly available production systems. Some resource adapters
have&nbsp; proprietary designs for solving this, but those
implementations will not be portable to other JMS providers. The
description above is assuming the MDB application does not have any
message selection capability of its own. </big><br>

<div style="text-align: left;">Figure 2 (below) shows how this issue is
addressed by generic jms ra. Apart from achieving load balancing
(improvised) of messages it also offers the same in a portable
way.&nbsp;
With minimal configuration to the MDB deployment descriptor and
addition of a JVM property to each instance,&nbsp; an improvised (
means not predictable and throttling may not be under control of user)
but very effective
solution can be obtained. The properties the ra instance expects to
achieve this are :<br>
a. Total number of instances in the cluster&nbsp; (InstanceCount lets
say N)<br>
b. The instance id of the instance in the cluster ( should be 0...N-1).<br>
<br>
and some optional properties like<br>
<br>
c LoadBalancingRequired (true by default)<br>
d. A custom message selector that can be used by the resource adapter.<br>

<br>
<br>
A selector is constructed using the above information in such a manner
that would result in each instance receiving unique messages. But
uniform message distribution (load) cannot be ensured. So, why is the
load balancing not predictable ? Its because the RA uses
the JMSTimestamp header present in the JMS message as part of&nbsp; the
message selector for load balancing. <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">For load balancing
to work in the generic jms ra (when a custom selector is not
specified), the JMS message should contain the JMSTimestamp header.</span>
<br>
JMSTimestamp is optional according to the JMS specification and can be
turned off by providers for increasing message throughput.<br>
Since this implementation uses the standard headers in the JMS message,
it is portable across different JMS providers as long as the timestamp
is present.<br>
<br>
Once the above configuration is deployed, then the messages received by
the instances are mutually exclusive. By design the selector guarantees
mutual exclusion and not symmetric load balancing. Load balancing is
implicit here, but is not actually based on how much load that the
instance is handling but is more dependent on the timestamps in the
message. It can be safely assumed that the timestamps in the messages
will be distributed ( may not be evenly) enough to simulate load
balancing.<br>
<br>
Any selectors that have been configured through the deployment
descriptors of the mdb ( as per the activation spec for describing
selectors) would be concatenated to selector created by the ra. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">RA configuration :</span><br>
<br>
The activation config property:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;activation-config-property&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;<span
 style="color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">InstanceCount</span>&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;<span
 style="color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">3</span>&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;/activation-config-property&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;activation-config-property&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;activation-config-property-name&gt;<span
 style="color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">LoadBalancingRequired</span>&lt;/activation-config-property-name&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;activation-config-property-value&gt;<span
 style="color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">true</span>&lt;/activation-config-property-value&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;/activation-config-property&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Instance count is the number of instances in the cluster. Any change in
the cluster configuration (addition/removal of instances) would require
the application to be redeployed. <br>
<br>
LoadBalancingRequired is a flag that tells the RA if it needs to
execute its load balancing logic. This has been provided to support
applications that might posses some intelligence for message processing
and do not rely on any of the resource adapter features. To disable the
load&nbsp; balancing, set the flag to false, default being true.<br>
<br>
JVM properties that need to be set for each instance in the cluster<br>
<br>
For instance 1<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; com.sun.genericra.loadbalancing.instance.id=0<br>
<br>
For instance 2:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; com.sun.genericra.loadbalancing.instance.id=1<br>
<br>
For instance 3:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; com.sun.genericra.loadbalancing.instance.id=2<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Customized load
balancing:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the user wants a
custom selector to be used by the RA which he feels would be more
effective and more adapted to the application, then the selector can be
supplied to the RA and the default load balancing can be over-ridden.
This selector should be configured for every instance in the
cluster.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><span

<br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: left;">RA Configuration for custom selector :<br>
<br>
(apart from the ones mentioned above)<br>
<br>
For instance 1: <br>
<br>
con.sun.genericra.loadbalancing.selector=&lt;someselector&gt; (e,g
JMSType = 'Instance1')<br>
(The JMSType header should be present in the message and should be
'Instance1', for instance 1 to process this message)<br>
<br>
For instance 2 :<br>
<br>
con.sun.genericra.loadbalancing.selector=&lt;someselector&gt; (e,g
JMSType = 'Instance2')<br>
(The JMSType header should be present in the message and should be
'Instance2', for instance 2 to process this message)<br>
<br>
For instance 3 :<br>
<br>
con.sun.genericra.loadbalancing.selector=&lt;someselector&gt; (e,g
JMSType = 'Instance3')<br>
(The JMSType header should be present in the message and should be
'Instance3', for instance 3 to process this message)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

<div style="text-align: left;"><br>

<div style="text-align: left;">By now, its quite evident that the
generic jms ra provides a simple but effective solution to handle
messages from topic destinations in an application cluster. Its also
clear that the implementation cannot adapt to changes in the cluster
configuration. The logic would fail ( or rather not perform as
expected) when an instance is added/removed from the cluster.<br>
