HOWTO: runs tests for the Generic Resource Adapter for JMS with Sun Java System Application Server 8.1 UR1 and above.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial Setup
-------------

1. Download and install Sun Java System Application Server Platform Edition 8.1 2005Q1 UR1 or above 
from http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/download.html#sdk

2a. Download and install Ant, and add it to your path (I used 1.7.1)

2b. Download ant-contrib from http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/ to your machine
   and copy the jar (I used ant-contrib-1.0b3.jar) to the lib directory of your ant installation

3. Environment settings

a. Set RA_HOME to the directory where the genericjmsra workspace is checked out
   Set S1AS_HOME to your application server installation directory
b. Modify $RA_HOME/config/config.properties based on your configuration.
c. Add S1AS_HOME/bin to your PATH.

Setup for running tests on WebLogic JMS
---------------------------------------

These tests require wlthint3client.jar which can be obtained from the WebLogic installation.

Glassfish 2.x: Copy the Weblogic T3 Client jar wlthint3client.jar to glassfish/lib

Edit the file test/common/common.properties: Modify the property appclient.cpath to include a path to wlthint3client.jar 

Setup for running tests in Glassfish MQ
----------------------------------------------------------

Glassfish 2.x: nothing to do

Glassfish 3.x: Copy imq.jar, imqutil.jar, imqjmx.jar, and imqbroker.jar from glassfish/mq/lib to glassfish/lib


To run all tests
----------------

1. Perform the steps outlined in the "Initial Setup" section above.

2. Start the application server

3. cd $RA_HOME/tests and type in 
	  ant all
   The "all" target deploys and configures the resource adapter, runs all the tests, 
   and undeploys the resource adapter.

4. The test run results are also placed at $RA_HOME/tests/genericratests.output.

To run an individual test
------------------------

1. Perform the steps outlined in the "Initial Setup" section above.

2. Start the application server

3. cd $RA_HOME/tests and type in 
	 ant gmq async xa setup (to deploy the GenericJMSRA RA in Glassfish to use Glassfish MQ with DeliveryType=Asynchronous) 
	 or
	 ant wljms sync noxa setup (to deploy the GenericJMSRA RA in Glassfish to use WebLogic JMS with DeliveryType=Synchronous) 
	 
	
4  cd $RA_HOME/tests/<the-test-you-want-to-run> and type in 
      ant gmq async all 
      
   if you prefer you can run each stage of the test separately: the tasks are
      ant gmq build
      ant gmq xa setup
      ant deploy
      ant run
      ant undeploy
      ant unsetup
      
5. After you have run the tests you want to run, cd $RA_HOME/tests and type in 
	 ant unsetup
